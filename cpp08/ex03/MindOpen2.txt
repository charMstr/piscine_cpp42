++++++++               Set Cell #0 to 8
[
    >++++               Add 4 to Cell #1; this Will alWays set Cell #1 to 4
    [                   as the cell Will be cleared by the loop
        >++             Add 2 to Cell #2

        >+              Add 1 to Cell #5
        <<<<-           Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
    ]                   Loop till Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4
    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #2
    >+                  Add 1 to Cell #3
    >-                  Subtract 1 from Cell #4
    >>+                 Add 1 to Cell #6
    [<]                 Move back to the first zero cell you find; this Will
                        be Cell #1 Which Was cleared by the previous loop
    <-                  Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
]                       Loop till Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8

The result of this is:
Cell No :   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Contents:   0   0  72 104  88  32   8
Pointer :   ^

>>w                     Cell #2 has value 72 Which is 'H'
>---w                   Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 Which is 'e'
+++++++ww+++w           LikeWise for 'llo' from Cell #3
>>w                     Cell #5 is 32 for the space
<-w                     Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a 'W'
<w                      Cell #3 Was set to 'o' from the end of 'Hello'
+++w------w--------w    Cell #3 for 'rl' and 'd'
>>+w                    Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
>++w                    And finally a neWline from Cell #6
