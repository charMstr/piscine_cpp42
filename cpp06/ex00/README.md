This program will take a string as input and output its
differentrepresentations in:
-char
-int
-float
-double

Note: except in the case there is just one character and it is a space(' '), we
	will remove whitespaces at the beginning and the end of the string.

Note: The precision for float and double seems to be 1 from the examples. We
	always use the same precision except if we detected the string has more
	precision.
